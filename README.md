## Aim: 
To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Algorithm: 
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.
## Procedure:
## Step 1: Choose the Content Type
a.Select the target output format:

1. Report

2. Article

3. Case Study

4. Creative Work (e.g., Story, Comic Script, etc.)

## Step 2: Apply Prompt Patterns
Use structured prompting techniques:

## 1.Query Decomposition:

Break a broad request into smaller, manageable sub-queries.

Example: Instead of "Write a case study," break it into:

What is the background?

What is the problem?

What was the solution?

What were the outcomes?

## 2.Decision-Making Prompts:

Add if-then-else logic or conditional phrasing in prompts.

Example: "If the tone should be professional, use formal vocabulary. Else, use conversational language."

## 3.Semantic Filtering:

Specify tone, vocabulary, audience, or structure constraints.

Example: "Generate a 500-word article in journalistic tone, targeted at startup founders, avoiding technical jargon."

## 4.Role-Based Prompting:

Instruct the model to take on specific roles.

Example: "Act as a marketing strategist and write a case study on a failed product launch."

## 5.Iterative Prompt Refinement:

After reviewing content, adjust prompts for structure, clarity, or depth.

Example: "Now rewrite the introduction to include a compelling hook and background."

## 6.Template-Based Prompting:

Use predefined structures for common content types.

## Example for a Report:
```python
makefile
Copy
Edit
Title: 
Introduction: 
Objectives: 
Methodology: 
Findings: 
Conclusion:
```

## Example Execution (Case Study)
Prompt Using Query Decomposition:

```python
Create a case study on a company's transition to remote work. 
1. Provide the company background.
2. Describe the problem they faced before remote work.
3. Explain the steps they took to implement remote work.
4. Analyze the outcomes and employee feedback.
5. Conclude with future plans and recommendations.
```


# Result :  
The corresponding prompt executed successfully.
